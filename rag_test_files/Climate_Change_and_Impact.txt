Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. The impact of climate change includes rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, and actions like reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices are key to mitigation.
