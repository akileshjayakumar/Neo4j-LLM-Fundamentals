The global economy is the interconnected economy of the world's nations, shaped by trade, investments, and economic policies. Trade involves the exchange of goods and services across borders and is a key driver of economic growth. However, it also leads to challenges such as trade imbalances, economic dependency, and fluctuations in currency values. Global trade organizations like the WTO play a crucial role in regulating international trade and resolving disputes.
