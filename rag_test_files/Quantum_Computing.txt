Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to process information, quantum computers use qubits. Quantum computing holds the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers, especially in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science.
