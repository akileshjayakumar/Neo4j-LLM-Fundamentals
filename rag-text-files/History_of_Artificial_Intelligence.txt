The history of artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to the 1950s when the concept of machines being able to mimic human intelligence was first proposed. Early AI was focused on rule-based systems and logical reasoning. Over time, advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities of AI, leading to applications in areas like natural language processing, robotics, and autonomous systems.
